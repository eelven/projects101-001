4.1 From Plan to Action (5:32)
Set of dependencies between the different taks associated with the project.
We were able to look at the network diagram and identify our critical path.
(video 01:00)
With that in mind, we could focus on the subset of tasks that will be
crucial for us as we walk through the project and which will be our central
attention, our critical tasks. These will guarantee that if we execute these
tasks on time, we will complete the project on time, as we expect.

(video 02:00) Project Life - Cycle -> Focusing on the execution stage
Initiate->Plan->Execute->Close

Initiate:
.Establish Organization
.Project charter and definition

Plan:
.Identify scope
.Identify tasks, dependencies and schedule
.Plan resources
.Clarify trades-offs and decision making principles
.Develop a risk management plan

Execute:
.Monitor
.Communicate and report
.Correct and control

Close:
.Sign off
.Conduct a formal post-mortem

Focusing on the execution stage, we tend to think about the following dimensions
How during the execution are we goingo to monitor our progress?
How will we communicate amongst the team and outside externally to the others
stakeholders?
Who will be doing the reporting?
How will we correct and take action when something isn't progressing as planned.

As we think about the execution, we think about monitoring (video 02:37)
Project Execution: Execute/Correct_and_Control/Monitor/Report_Collect
How will the monitoring be done?
Will it be physical or virtual?
Is our project manager in the same location as the teams?
Do they work together in such a way that they can actually view the work?
Or perhaps is a virtual system for collaborative platform going to be used.
And how often should we ve looking at it?
Are we going to look at our system every day and expect updates to be made in real time?
Or are we going to be looking at it on a weekly or bi-weekly basis?
Is there a central project management office?
Does that office aggregate information from multiple projects in an organization, and 
do they share the same resources?
Does the project manager get support from that office and have others on his team who can
help him work through any problems that come up?
What information will actually be monitored?
Are we monitoring in time?
Are we monitoring the actual costs?
And how are we going to be monitoring functionality of the product as we execute and develop
the product?
In terms of reporting and collecting the information, this is a not a trivial step
How often are we expecting updates reports?
Are we expecting our team to call us everyday and to tell us how they're doing?
Are we scheduling a weekly meeting to talk about the execution and the progression
of the project?
Who is going to be in charge of these meetings?
Who is going to attend them?
Are only the individual associated with the tasks going to show up?
Or are all the stakeholders or related parties going to show up in order to share and
learn from the execution of our project.
Once we've collected the information and the reporting has been done, then what?
How do we correct action if something has gone wrong?
If a red flag is raised and we are behind schedule, what do we do ?
(video 04:26)
It is important identify what sort of decisions will be made.
Do we have some flexibility in terms of the scope?
And who can make the call on reducing the scope?
Who has the ability to hire additional personnel or to outsource and to seek an
expert to come and help us solve a problem?
Assuming that we have reached a conclusion that we need to take action, and we've
taken a corrective action and gone out and found an expert to help us, How will we
communicate to the rest of the team where we're heading from here?
How will updates be communicated in terms of change of directions and an alternative
path that we're all going to have to follow from this point onwards?
These are the types of questions that are on our mind as we work through the execution,
as we start the execution, and throughout the entire execution of the project. And we
will se several different ways in which this can be done.
