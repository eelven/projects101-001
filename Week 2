2.1 Why Plan? (3:28)
Drucker's Effective Execute tells us what an action plan should look like:
An (action) Plan is:
.Statement of intentionsâ‰ Commitment
.Not a straitjacket
.Should be revised often
.Should anticipate to need to be flexible
.Needs a system for checking the results against expectatations

In addittion, a plan has to become the basis for executive time management,
it informs the way we plan, the evolutuin of our executives, and the time
that they spend, in the way they spend operating our business.
A project plan is very specific, and it's going to include the following
components.
A project plan is going to include identifying the scope (1:20), it is
going to include a phase of identifying all the tasks, the dependencies
among them and the schedule.
In order to ultimately come up with an actual duration and time frame for
the completion of our project
As part of our plan, we're also going to be thinking of our resources and
how many we need and when do we need them. We're going to be clarifying 
the trade offs that we're going to be making in terms of cost, resources
versus time.
And finally, we're going to develop a robust and a useful risk management
plan that will allow us to cope with changes in our future throughout the
life of the project.
One of the critical reasons why we plan projects is to help us bridge the
gap between the .-.>initiation<.-. phase and the .-.>execution<.-.
The plan allows us to reflect on the obhectives that we set and to realize
whether they're even feasible. It also allows us to come up with ideas
around how we plan to execute our project and what kind of mechanisms need
to be in place. The project management office, office, how it's going to
look like, where it's physically going to be located, what type of meeting
will occur, how often, and the plan gives us some indication as to what is 
needed and when. What are the pressure point of the project, milestones 
that have to be hit, and how we can plan accordingly.

In general, there is no prescribed rule to tell you how long you should
spend planning, but one of the most important, factors, is to realize that,
while you do plan, even if you've moved to the execution phase, and even
if you want to progress the project, you might have to go back and amend
your plan.
The plan is only there to start the process off. it is a work in progress
and it is a continuous improvement on our expectations.
