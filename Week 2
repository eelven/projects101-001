2.1 Why Plan? (3:28)
Drucker's Effective Execute tells us what an action plan should look like:
An (action) Plan is:
.Statement of intentionsâ‰ Commitment
.Not a straitjacket
.Should be revised often
.Should anticipate to need to be flexible
.Needs a system for checking the results against expectatations

In addittion, a plan has to become the basis for executive time management,
it informs the way we plan, the evolutuin of our executives, and the time
that they spend, in the way they spend operating our business.
A project plan is very specific, and it's going to include the following
components.
A project plan is going to include identifying the ->|scope|<- (1:20), it
is going to include a phase of identifying all the ->|tasks|<-, the
->|dependencies|<- among them and the ->|schedule|<-.
In order to ultimately come up with an actual duration and time frame for
the completion of our project.
As part of our plan, we're also going to be thinking of our resources and
how many we need and when do we need them. We're going to be clarifying 
the trade offs that we're going to be making in terms of cost, resources
versus time.
And finally, we're going to develop a robust and a useful risk management
plan that will allow us to cope with changes in our future throughout the
life of the project.
One of the critical reasons why we plan projects is to help us bridge the
gap between the .-.>initiation<.-. phase and the .-.>execution<.-.
The plan allows us to reflect on the obhectives that we set and to realize
whether they're even feasible. It also allows us to come up with ideas
around how we plan to execute our project and what kind of mechanisms need
to be in place. The project management office, office, how it's going to
look like, where it's physically going to be located, what type of meeting
will occur, how often, and the plan gives us some indication as to what is 
needed and when. What are the pressure point of the project, milestones 
that have to be hit, and how we can plan accordingly.

In general, there is no prescribed rule to tell you how long you should
spend planning, but one of the most important, factors, is to realize that,
while you do plan, even if you've moved to the execution phase, and even
if you want to progress the project, you might have to go back and amend
your plan.
The plan is only there to start the process off. it is a work in progress
and it is a continuous improvement on our expectations.

2.2 Detailed Scoping (6:02)
The 1st. step in planning a project is scoping the project properly.
This step is probably the most neglected step in the entire process
of planning a project. We rush too quickly to look at timing and 
Gantt charts.
In order to scope the project properly, we often use a tool, or we
recommend using a tool called the work breakdown structure. It's a 
visual tool that's literally going to break down the project into
working components.

Work Breakdown Structure
.Visually breaks down project scope
..Project
..Subprojects
..Work packages
..Activities / Tasks

Once we brainstorm, either in the form of a blackboard, sticky notes,
or on white board, then we can use certain tools and software in order
to organize these thoughts in a more acessible way (2:27)
The process of going through, the brainstorming process of going through
and identifying what is part of our project and what we might want to 
leave out of this specific project, is vital before we even start looking
at the schedule.

Work Breakdown Structure - Tips
.Use Sticky notes/blackboard/white board
Start with something that you can easily amend; either by pacing sticky notes
on the board, reorganizing them. Use a team of people to brainstorm, and work 
together with individuals, including those who are actually going to do, be 
doing the work; or your clients, who you might need to deliver the product to
in order to make sure that the scope is well defined.
.Use automated tools e.g. MS Project, WBSPro
.Detail down to no less than 5%-10% of the total duration or a single resource

Now if you can't get to the level of detail that is required, it implies that 
you might not be talking to the right people and you might need to find out 
more information about the scope of your project so the first step is coming up
with a work breakdown structure.
Now, we know the scope of a project.

2.3 Identifying Dependencies (5:48)

There are 3 ways to looko at the dependencies:

Work Breakdown Structure
-Start Project
--Creative
--Strategy
--IT
--Fundraising
--Marketing
--Sales
--Finance
--HR

1-The disign matrix typically has the list of activities in the column and
the list of the activities in the rows. (video 01:00)

2-The table (video 02:40)

3-Network Diagram (03:03)

Types of Dependencies
finish -> start
finish -> finish
start -> finish 
start -> start

2.4 Determine the Copletion Data and Critical Path (17:09)

For planning a project, we first scoped our project using a work 
breakdown structure.

Work Breakdown Structure
-Start Project
--Creative
--Strategy
--IT
--Fundraising
--Marketing
--Sales
--Finance
--HR

The next step in planning our project was to come up with the precedence
relationship; wich tasks are dependent on others an how are they depend?
We came up with the following list (00:33)

Estimatting Activity Durations can be Tricky! (02:05)
-Parkinson's Law
We plain for activity to take a certain amount of weeks, be sure that the 
work will fill up the entire duration

- Student's Syndrome
If I give you 4 weeks to complete a task, you are like to not even start
working on that task until the very last minute 

-Overconfidence
-Biases
  --Anchoring
  --Confirmation
  
(video 07:15)

Critical Path (14:14)
- The longest path in the project/network.
- The project duration, defined by the length of the critical path, is also
known as makespan.
- A delay in any activity along the critical path will cause a delay in the
project
- The method was developed by Engineers at DuPont Corporation in the 1950s.

steps in MS Project.

2.5 How Do We Schedule? (03:04)

We've carried out a critical path analysis to come up with our project duration estimate
and to identify which of the activities in our network, in our project, are critical.
Those critical tasks have zero slack, they need to start as soon as we can and they
need to finish on time.
However, let's think about the noncritical tasks. When do we think that we would like
to perform the work? (00:35)

Depending on your project priorities and your project objectives, you might want to go
with one schedule versus the other, the other.
Let's think about the benefits of an as soon as possible schedule versus a late as 
possible schedule.

ASAP or ALAP?
------------------------------------|
As Soon as Possible |   Cost  | Time|
                          X       V
As Late as Possible |   Cost  | Time|
                          V       X
------------------------------------|
What is it that we care about?
Are we constrained by cost or by time?
We need to invest cost now in order to gain slack and bugger in terms of
our timing.
On the flip side, if we are constrained by costs, and we are working with
a limited budget and we know that maybe ca, time is something that we 
compromise on, we're better off pushing our tasks as late as possible.
As late as possible schedule delays the commitment of cost, delays the
commitment of resources untill a time that we know we must use it.
Costs futher down in the future are cheaper. However it eats, it eats
up all the slack. Postponing the tasks mean that we leave ourself with 
very little slack towards the end of our project and if we need extra
time, we will not have it. and so if our priority is cost, you're
better off scheduling as late as possible

2.6 What If I Don't Like Planning? Making Changes? (03:41)

Imagine that we're gone through all the steps: scoped the project and identified
all the different activites that need to take place. We've identified the precedence
relationships and we've estimated the task durations to find the overall project
expected completion time, and overall duration. 
But now, you realize that it's way too long. You don't have 12 weeks available to
you. You need to shorten your project. You need to meet a deadline. What can you do?
Well, luckily, the tools and the steps that we've taken so far will be critical and
will help us in identifying ways to shorten our project duration. And we're going
to start by those tasks that we identified as part of the critical path. The critical
path is the only way to focus our attention and to shorten our project duration. We 
start by identifying those tasks on the critical path that are candidate to shortening, 
or to crashing.
Project Crashing
.Project duration can be reduced only by shortening critical activities.
.It may be worth spending money to reduce the length of a project.
.  ->Select the least expensive to crash.
.New critical paths may emerge.
. ->reduce all critical paths!
We think about what do we need to spend in order to reduce their duration
Do we need to include additional resources?
Do we need to spend more money?
Once we've identified the least expensive task amoung the critical tasks that
we are going to be able to shorten, we start experimenting with shortening the
duration.
 But pay very carefull attention !  As you start shortening task duration, a new
 critical path, a new longest path in your project might emerge and therefore, 
 you might need to take your attention elsewhere and start crashing other 
 activities from other parallel paths. We need to conduct this crashing 
 activity or reducing the project duration in a cycle. We identify our critical
 tasks. We find the least expensive task to reduce its duration. We reduce its
 duration, and we identify the new critical path that might have emerged.
 All the critical paths, even if there are multiple of them, will need to be
 shortened in order for our overall project duration to be reduced.
 In the process of doung this, what's going to happen? Well, a few things.
 
 As a Result of Project Crashing
 .Critical path
 ..Shorter
 ..May change : We might introduce a new critical path and a new set of critical activities
 ..More activities may become critical
 .Higher risk?
 
But if we need to meet that external deadline, we might be willling to take upon
ourserlves that risk, reduce the slack in our project. Have more activities shortened
and tightened in their duration in order to meet the overall deliverable date.
If it's not possible to invest additional resources in order to reduce some of our 
ritical tasks, another alternative is to go back to our scope. Reflect on what is
ecessary, and look at our work breakdown structure. Can we eliminate some 
nnecessary tasks? Can we reduce the functionality of our product, and perhaps, 
postpone some functionatily to a later version or to a later phase?

Reducing Scope
.Eliminate activities
.Unncessary
 .Reduce functionality
 .Cut corners
 .Oursource
 
If we do that, and maybe we consider some areas where we can cut corners, or
perhaps, outsource some of the work. We might be able to reduce the project
completion time by looking at the scope, reducing the scope, and not 
necessarily accelerating our tasks. Depending on our trade offs among our 
objectives, if we're limited by this, if we're constrained by our scope, 
by our time or by cost, we can choose how to investigate reducing the overall
project duration.
