1.3 How Do We Define a Project? (5:52)

5 aspects ot the project definition:
. What is the Goal?
. The 3 objectives:
-Scope
-Time
-Budget
. Establish Organization

Holy Trinity because each one of these(S, T, B) might pull in a different way

1.4 Considering the Organization and Stakeholders (5:59)

1. Who will be doing the work?
: our own employees or external contractors?
2.Who is the Project Manager?
:Is he familiar with our company? with employees? Is he new?
3.Who is paying for the project?
:Who and when will those funds be available?
4.Who will consume the product or service?
:Who is our final costumer?
5.Who are those effected by the project?
:The general public, government, How might they dectate outcomes related to our project?

Stakeholder Cycle: (1:49)
7 steps:
1-Identify Stakeholders
2-Gather Information
3-Healthy Eating! Organic and Safe!
4-Determine Strenghts and Weaknesses
5-Predict Stakeholder Behavior
6-Implement Stakeholder Management Strategy

Identify all stakeholders that are affected by our project and success of our project, we 
gather information about them and we identify their mission. We determine their strength
and their weaknesses and especially, we pay attention to how those strength and weaknesses
will affect our project and the success of our project. Then we might predict their behavior,
depending on alternative strategies that we might deploy, and we identify the strategy that 
we would like to incorporate into our project plan.

A framework that is very popular is thinking about a power interest grid
This framework was developed quite a while ago by Ed Freeman, at Darton, Virginia.
Ed talks about identifying where our stakeholders fall onto main axes, power and interests.
Are they high power or low power? High interest or low interest?  (3:59)
Once you've identify where our stakeholders fall, that will imply a certain strategy and a
certain type of interaction.
For instance, stakeholders that have low power and are low itnerest, we just want to monitor,
make sure that there is no change.
Similarly, stakeholders that might have high power and low interest, we would like to keep
satisfied and we would like to keep them satisfied because the outcome of them not being
satisfied is critical and important to think about. If those stakeholders that have high
power and low interest are not satisfied and they become high interest stakehokders, that is,
propably a signal to us that something is not going well with our project. And therefore, if
we keep them satisfied, (4:42), they will remain where they are at the low interest quadrant.
Some of the key projects in history that we've heard of, large scale projects that we know of
that were not successful, typically fail on this idea of identifying their stakeholders and
identifying their innovation properly.
When we set out to plan a project, we are thoughtful on the organization and the different
stakeholders and their role in our project looking forward.

1.5 Project Success and Failure (5:41)

Main Reasons for Failure
.Little or no planning: no clear goal, scope or estimated timeline
.Lack of leadership and commitment by stakeholders
.Lack of training on new technology
.No lessons learned from historical projects
.Lack of proper project management training
.Biases: optmism, sunk costs, confirmation

4 Bases for Successful Projects by Aaron Shenhar and Dov Dvir. (3:25)
4 apects or 4 axis that we might want to consider and map our project onto, technology,
novelty, pace, and complexity.
by thoughtfully identifying where our project lies on each one of these dimensions, we
will identify the proper tools and techniques by which to manage our projects. And that
will guarantee, or at least, improve our chances of success. So for instance if we're 
about to begin a new project, and we've identified that this prokect, for instance, (3:57)
is low on technology it's a low tech project and we believe that it is derivative,
in terms of its novelty and that the pace in which it's required to hit the market is 
neither regular or blitz. There is some urgency, but it is not severe. And on the
dimension of complexity, we rate it as moderately complex.
If we identify that and that is not correct, we will probably choose the wrong set of 
techniques and tools to manage our projects and in reality if it turns out that we were
dealing with a much more complex technology and it was much more high tech than we are
probably going to find ourselves failing to deliver on time, on budget and within the scope.

Another key factor that we need to think about is how are we going to measure the success of 
our project?
When we talking about a success of a project, we define it with respect to its objectives and
so we need to go back and revisit our project objectives.
(5:11) And so, a successful project will be a project that is on time, on budget, and delivers
the scope.
We're going to ask:
-Was it on time, was it late? and by how much?
-Was it over or under budget? and by how much?
-Was on time? did it deliver its promised deliverables? where the customers satisfied at the time
of the project completion?
Answering these questions will help us determine wheter our projects are sucessful or not.

1.7 Project Life-Cycle (4:49)

When we think about the project life-cycle, we think about 4 different stages.(0:22)
Initiate->Plan->Execute->Close

Initiate:
.Establish Organization
.Project charter and definition

Plan:
.Identify scope
.Identify tasks, dependencies and schedule
.Plan resources
.Clarify trades-offs and decision making principles
.Develop a risk management plan

Execute:
.Monitor
.Communicate and report
.Correct and control

Close:
.Sign off
.Conduct a formal post-mortem

Initiation->Planning->Execution->Close-Out

In some situations, we might plan and go back to our initiation and change our project definition.
We might start executing and realize that we've faced an uncertainty that we didn't anticipate and
go back and make correction to our plan.
By nature, the life cycle of a project could be iterative, and it's not that we're going to move
sequentially betwwen these segments.

Some organizations, many new product development companies like to take a broader look and stand
back and think about the execution of a project in the context of a Stage-Gate Process. (3:50)
The Stage-Gate Process allows for reflection as we progress through the life cycle and as we 
progress in our development of our product. We might have a gate, an opportunity to reflect, to
deliver a piece of work and to have a decision made along the way and we formalize it and control
the flow of our project as it matures and as we gain clarity on the content and what the product
will be doing. Regardless of whether you use the Stage-Gate Process, or whether you use a different
process, identifying the life cycle and acknowledging the fact that you may need to iterate between
the different stages and taking into account, and taking time to reflect on a project when it's done,
as part of your step of closing the project, are crucial in our evolution and our improvement of the
execution of our projects.
