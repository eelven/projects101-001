3.1 What's Is Risk About Projects? (7:47)
So we've planned our project. We've come up with the correct scope,
we've come up with the dependencies amoung the tasks, calculated the
completion time of our project. So let's start implementing, Let's 
execute our project.
Part of our planning is going to pause after the initial first steps
and thing about what risks do we foresee in the exectuion of our project
and can we plan and amend our plans accordingly in order to better face
those risks as they manifest themselves?
Before we start thinking about the tools that we're goingo to use in 
order to incorporate risks and uncertainty into a project plan, let's
try and identify ehat is the source of the uncertainty and where the
risk's coming from as we think about projects and the execution of
projects.
Christoph Loch's Terminology at INSEAD, we're going to be thinking
about uncertainly on several dimensions (3)
video(01:21)
1-Foreseeable Uncertainties (Uncertainty)
-Variability
-Alternative Paths
2-Complexity  (Risks)
-Project Tasks
-Stakeholders
3-Unforseen Uncertainties (Ambiguity)
-Novel technology
-Novel markets

Plan to Match Risk (05:14)
If you think about your project, you think about your industry and
you think about the activities that you're about to engage in,
mapping them on the two axis (Ambiguity, Complexity) will allow you
to identify the best way forward. And so, if your project has few
interactions, it is not highly complex. Tasks are either very
sequential or not many stakeholders involved at the same time with
your project. Than perhaps you can use a mmore straightforward
planning tools that we've introduced so far.
video(05:50)
When there is low variation in your project, low uncertaintly, and
few interaction, just straightforward planning will suffice.
As we introduce more interactions, more complexity, and there is a
high degree if risk introduced from the complexity that our project
entails, then we would like to add additional avenues to planning 
and executing our project.
We would like to encourage fast response, and allow our
decision-makers and those who execute in the field to take more
authority and react quicker to changes in their working environment.
If our anbiguity goes up, and we are dealing with still foreseeable
events, and we have few interactions, we can come up with a risk
management plan, that allows us to plan mitigation, contigencies,
and reactions to uncertainties as they unfold during the life cycle
of the project.
The more we move into the domain of highly complex and highly
ambiguous projects with unknown unknowns, or void a novelty that
we cannot articulate and plan for and scope out upfront. Then
we must include an opportunity for trial and error, for parallel
exploration, in order to be able to learn and to gain information
about the area of our expertise. and so the traditional project
planning tolls that we've been focused on so far are going to be
less useful in those environment and scoping will require a
different mindset and the execution that will follow will allow
for parallel experimentation and for mistakes to be made and for
information to be gained. As we move forward, and look , and
comceptualize how to plan our risk or how to plan for the risk
and uncertainties in our project, remember this mapping. and
remember to identify where your project falls in order to come up
with the best mitigation plan and the best set of execution rules
for your project.

3.2 Identifying and Assessing Project Risks (09:52)

The 1st step in properly managing our risk is to come up with a risk management plan
This will allow us to identify the key drivers and the impact and come up with a 
mitigation or solution to dealing with those risks throughout the execution of
our project.
4 steps are included in coming up with a risk management plan. We're going to start
with identification, identifying the risks,  assessing them, planning our response
and them monitoring and controlling during the actual execution of the project.
(video 0:25)

Identification (00:40)
-Brainstorming, checklists, previous project, experts
-Risk Register
During the identification, we want to bring together all the different stakeholders
or representatives of those groups, individual with a lot of expertise that have done
similar projects or have been in different or inspiring industries before. They will 
help us together and come up with a very detailed and thorough list. and identifying 
all the different risks that could occur throughout the life of our project.
We can look at the historical data, databases to come up with actual statistics
associated with those risks. or we can consult with experts and learn from their 
experiencies. read post mortem reports, and come up with a risk register, or a list
of possible risks that could occur to our project. These could be risks associated
with the scope, duration or associated with the cost of our project.

Assessment
-Impact
-Likelihood
-Prioritized Risk Register
Well. how likely are they occur, and what is the impact if they do occur?
Is it goingo to end up being minor and not affect our project? Or will it
catastrophic, not only for our project, but perhaps to our entire company?
The combination of Impact and the Likelihood of a risk to occur gives us
some sense of priority.

Response Planning
-Identify response strategy to each risk
-Assign responsibilities

Once we've identified the set of risks that we need to think about, how likely
they are to occur, what is the impact if they do occur, and we've prioritized
them, then we can start planning a response.
We can identify how we would like to deal with each one of those risks in our
Risk Register. and perhaps most importantly, we can identify and assign a
responsible individual in our firm that will monitor that source of risk and
that will raise the red flag and allow us to get plenty of alert and plenty
of warning in advance of a risk occurring. That responsibility, that owner of
a risk, will insure that our project execution is impacted to the minimal degree,
from the reality, as it unfolds.

Monitoring and Control
-Update risk probabilities
-Execute planned strategy if events occur
Once we move into the execution of the project and we monitor and control our
different tasks, then we think carefully about updating our risk plan.
The Risk Register is a living document, as we progress through the project, we learn
more about the nature of the work, we learn more about the world around us, we can
update the probabilities and the impact that different risks impose on our project
plan or our project itself. And therefore, as the project progresses, we might change
the priorities in our Risk Register and we might focus on the different set of risks 
later on in the project than we thought up front.

Hopefully, if everything is in place, we have the set of tools and we have the
strategies and we have the capability to deal with the risk as it unfolds or as it
occurs in reality.
Let's focus a little bit on the assessment component.
How do we think about the impact and the likelihood? And how do those come together
to form a priority and to establish our strategy, in case of dealing with each one
of our risks? One accessible way that many folks like to think about the assessment
component, is to think about a matrix. 
(video 03:53)
Map the risks identified on this metric (video 04:24)
How lilely are they to occur, and what is the impact if they do?
(video 04:25)
As we map our different risks and our different events onto this matrix, it will
give us an idication on how we might want to plan the strategy to deal with
those risks.
If we're faced with that kind of risk which is extreme in nature, we may wnat a 
mitigation plan. We may want to find a way to avoid it completely and remove that
event or that risk on the horizon from even occurring, and so, we might develop a 
backup system in case things go awry. We might consult with other firms to develop
parallel attempts at comming up with a new baggage system, all in order to make sure
that we've mitigated away that risk from occuring. Contigency pans might be helpfull
in some cases. Mitigation plans could be helpful in other instances. We might also 
want to think about redundancy, meaning having 2 parallel paths to ensure that if one
goes wrong, we have a backup in place, We could also think about hedging, if the risks
are financial in nature and have cost implication, we can look at the financial markets
and come up with a hedge plan. to ensure that we don't find ourselves vulnerable on
the cost frontier.
Many consulting firms, like McKinsey, like to think about it, like to take these 2 
dimensions of likehood and impact, and push it a step further in order to come up with
the priority score. In order to come up with a score of the risk that allows us to
prioritize our risk in our risk register.
(video 07:53)
Probability Impact Matrix
Risk Score = Probability x Impact
(07:53)
In order to do that, we need to take our impact factor, which we've previously talked
about from insignificant to catastrophic, quantify it, assign a certain number, and then
we can multiply together the probability of occurrence with the impact that it will entail.
These numbers naturally give us come kind of ordering among the different risks, and therefore
we use the risk score to come up with the priority, prioritize our risks. Which are the
most extreme, that require attention immediately? and which can we have at the botton of our
list with the proper contingency in place, but they're not requiring ongoing attentions right now.

We've gained a lot of information, we've identified our risks, we've conceptualized the
likelihood that they will occur, the impact that they will have if they do occur, we've come
up with a risk score, and we put it all together in the Risk Register. 
(video 08:49)
This is a living document.
This is a document that allows us to monitor the progress and to make sure that we're all aware
of the sources of risk that we might face and what is the strategy that we have put in place
in case they occur?
Most importantly, we identify an owner, an individual that is responsible for tracking how things
are going, that will alert us if things have gone wrong. And that will raise the red flag or call
for the additional resourcers when the time comes in order to deal with one of these risks that
emerge.
(video 09:21)
In reality, these risk registers might be very big and have many different tasks associated with them.
They might require a lot of attention, but they are vital part of our planning process and they are
crucial for the success of our project because they allow us to walk into the project, and
start executing the tasks immediately, knowing that we have a plan to follow in case things go bad.
