3.1 What's Is Risk About Projects? (7:47)
So we've planned our project. We've come up with the correct scope,
we've come up with the dependencies amoung the tasks, calculated the
completion time of our project. So let's start implementing, Let's 
execute our project.
Part of our planning is going to pause after the initial first steps
and thing about what risks do we foresee in the exectuion of our project
and can we plan and amend our plans accordingly in order to better face
those risks as they manifest themselves?
Before we start thinking about the tools that we're goingo to use in 
order to incorporate risks and uncertainty into a project plan, let's
try and identify ehat is the source of the uncertainty and where the
risk's coming from as we think about projects and the execution of
projects.
Christoph Loch's Terminology at INSEAD, we're going to be thinking
about uncertainly on several dimensions (3)
video(01:21)
1-Foreseeable Uncertainties (Uncertainty)
-Variability
-Alternative Paths
2-Complexity  (Risks)
-Project Tasks
-Stakeholders
3-Unforseen Uncertainties (Ambiguity)
-Novel technology
-Novel markets

Plan to Match Risk (05:14)
If you think about your project, you think about your industry and
you think about the activities that you're about to engage in,
mapping them on the two axis (Ambiguity, Complexity) will allow you
to identify the best way forward. And so, if your project has few
interactions, it is not highly complex. Tasks are either very
sequential or not many stakeholders involved at the same time with
your project. Than perhaps you can use a mmore straightforward
planning tools that we've introduced so far.
video(05:50)
When there is low variation in your project, low uncertaintly, and
few interaction, just straightforward planning will suffice.
As we introduce more interactions, more complexity, and there is a
high degree if risk introduced from the complexity that our project
entails, then we would like to add additional avenues to planning 
and executing our project.
We would like to encourage fast response, and allow our
decision-makers and those who execute in the field to take more
authority and react quicker to changes in their working environment.
If our anbiguity goes up, and we are dealing with still foreseeable
events, and we have few interactions, we can come up with a risk
management plan, that allows us to plan mitigation, contigencies,
and reactions to uncertainties as they unfold during the life cycle
of the project.
The more we move into the domain of highly complex and highly
ambiguous projects with unknown unknowns, or void a novelty that
we cannot articulate and plan for and scope out upfront. Then
we must include an opportunity for trial and error, for parallel
exploration, in order to be able to learn and to gain information
about the area of our expertise. and so the traditional project
planning tolls that we've been focused on so far are going to be
less useful in those environment and scoping will require a
different mindset and the execution that will follow will allow
for parallel experimentation and for mistakes to be made and for
information to be gained. As we move forward, and look , and
comceptualize how to plan our risk or how to plan for the risk
and uncertainties in our project, remember this mapping. and
remember to identify where your project falls in order to come up
with the best mitigation plan and the best set of execution rules
for your project.
